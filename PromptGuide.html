- Properties with critical overdue items
- Recommendations for improving compliance rates</code></pre>

    <h2 id="intermediate">Intermediate Prompts</h2>
    <p>These prompts involve combining multiple datasets and more complex analysis.</p>

    <h3>I1: Damp & Mould Risk Factors</h3>
    <pre><code>Combine data from damp_mould_incidents_master.csv, imputed_master_properties_enriched.csv, and iot_enriched.csv to identify risk factors for damp and mould.
Include:
- Correlation between property characteristics and damp/mould incidents
- Impact of temperature and humidity readings on damp/mould occurrence
- Property age and construction type as risk factors
- Block or estate-level patterns
- Recommendations for targeted preventative measures</code></pre>

    <h3>I2: Financial Performance Analysis</h3>
    <pre><code>Analyze financial_performance_property.csv, financial_property_valuations.csv, and rent_payments_enriched_final.csv to assess the financial health of the housing stock.
Include:
- Properties with the best and worst ROI
- Correlation between property characteristics and financial performance
- Impact of void periods on overall returns
- Trends in property valuations over time
- Recommendations for improving financial performance</code></pre>

    <h3>I3: Tenant Vulnerability and Support Needs</h3>
    <pre><code>Combine tenants_enriched_master.csv, tenant_feedback_master.csv, and maintenance_requests_master.csv to identify vulnerable tenants and their support needs.
Include:
- Patterns in vulnerability flags and their correlation with other factors
- Maintenance needs specific to vulnerable tenants
- Satisfaction levels among vulnerable tenants compared to others
- Areas where additional support services might be needed
- Recommendations for targeted support programs</code></pre>

    <h3>I4: Compliance Risk Assessment</h3>
    <pre><code>Analyze compliance_master.csv, imputed_master_properties_enriched.csv, and financial_budgets_property.csv to create a risk-based compliance strategy.
Include:
- High-risk properties based on compliance history and property characteristics
- Correlation between maintenance spending and compliance status
- Cost implications of compliance failures
- Prioritized list of properties needing immediate attention
- Recommendations for a risk-based inspection schedule</code></pre>

    <h2 id="advanced">Advanced Prompts</h2>
    <p>These prompts involve complex multi-dataset analysis, predictive elements, and strategic recommendations.</p>

    <h3>A1: Predictive Maintenance Model</h3>
    <pre><code>Using maintenance_requests_master.csv, imputed_master_properties_enriched.csv, iot_enriched.csv, and energy_enriched.csv, develop a framework for a predictive maintenance model.
Include:
- Key indicators that predict future maintenance needs
- Property characteristics that correlate with specific repair types

    <h2 id="tips">Tips for Effective AI Analysis</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Data Preparation</strong>: Ensure your data is properly loaded and formatted. For large files, consider using sample data first.</li>
      <li><strong>Context Matters</strong>: Provide AI with context about the housing association, objectives, and any specific concerns.</li>
      <li><strong>Iterative Approach</strong>: Start simple and build complexity as you become familiar with the data.</li>
      <li><strong>Verification</strong>: Always verify AI-generated insights against raw data for critical decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Prompt Refinement</strong>: Refine prompts to be more specific if initial results aren't helpful.</li>
      <li><strong>Combine Approaches</strong>: Use AI along with traditional statistical methods and domain expertise.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethical Considerations</strong>: Be mindful of privacy and ethics when analyzing tenant data.</li>
